## Summary
#### Machine Learning can help accelerate the time consuming data analysis process to find planets outside our solar systemü™ê! To achieve this, I trained Random Forest, Logistic Regression models, and Convolutional neural network (CNN) to detect the planet's transit signal with the data from the Kepler space telescope. Using accuracy, sensitivity and precision as performance evaluation metrics, these models scored:
| [Model](https://github.com/siudro/ExoPlanets-Classifier/tree/main/models) | [Random Forest](https://github.com/siudro/ExoPlanets-Classifier/blob/main/models/RandomForest/RandomForest3(best%20results).ipynb) | [Logistic Regression](https://github.com/siudro/ExoPlanets-Classifier/blob/main/models/Logistic-Regression/LogisticRegression4(best%20results)_.ipynb) | [CNN](https://github.com/siudro/ExoPlanets-Classifier/blob/main/models/CNN/CNN2(best%20results).ipynb) |
| :---: |     :---:      |          :---: |          :---: |
| Accuracy | 99.08%     | 99.08%    | 99.12%    |
| Precision | 99.08%       | 99.08%      | 100%    |
| Sensitivity(True detection rate) | 100%       | 100%      | 100%    |

## What is an Exoplanet?
#### Exoplanet: *Extra-solar planet*, meaning that there are other stars that can be similar to our sun, that have planets orbiting around them and located outside our solar system.
## What is a planet's transit?
#### There are many ways to detect a planetary system, but the most used method is *time transit*.
#### A transit occurs when a planet passes in front of a star, resulting in a slight periodic drop in the star's light intensity, and is referred to as the *transit signal*.

#### Once a transit signal is detected, we may use Kepler's third law of planetary motion to determine the planet's orbital size and the period required for the planet to orbit the star. These information are helpful to answer many questions about the planet, such as whether it is habitable or not!

## Data
#### Dataset of kepler's time series from [kagle](https://www.kaggle.com/keplersmachines/kepler-labelled-time-series-data)

## Data Preprocessing
#### Data splitting, removing outliers and instrumental noise, dropping nulls, reshaping values, then scaling and transformation have been performed, to make it easier to detect a transit-like signal.
